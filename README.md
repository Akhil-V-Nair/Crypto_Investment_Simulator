# Crypto_Investment_Simulator
Project where an investment simulator is created based on Historical Data of Crypto Currencies.

Use of Pandas, Numpy and Visualizations to collect a subset of Crytocurrencies from all the available currencies and for that subset of Market, a plot for explained PCA Variance is plotted. The plot shows how, Bitcoin influences the price of other coins in the Market.
A similar plot is created after 1-maxing the range of Prices and compared with the actual Plot.

Also a simulator is created to know the returns on investing a particular amount everyday in three different methods for Two Years.
This is not a Predictive Analysis, because of it's Volatility and Unstability in market.
